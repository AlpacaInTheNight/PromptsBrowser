# Prompts Browser Extension 0.1
Prompts Browser Extension for the AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui client

installation:

1. install node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download>
The collections server runs on node. In the future I plan to rewrite the server in python and get rid of the dependency on node. but since I don't know python, this will take time.

2. Unzip/clone the plugin into the `extensions/PromptsBrowser` folder.

3. In the stable-diffusion folder will be created folder `prompts_catalogue` with subfolder `myprompts` - this will be the first collection of prompts. As well as the folder `styles_catalogue` where new styles will be stored.
